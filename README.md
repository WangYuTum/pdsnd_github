## Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Python Project
The goal of the project is to investivate **Bike Share Data** provided by **[Motivate](motivateco.com)**.
For simplicity, we will only explore data for the first six months of 2017 from the following cities:
- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington, DC

The project implements an interactive script that let users filter and explore raw data and generate some 
descriptive statistics. This project is created on Aug 14th, 2020.

### Requirements
The project uses the following programming language and packages:
- Python 3.6
- Numpy 1.19.1
- Pandas 1.1.0

### Data and Files used
The original data is provided by **[Motivate](motivateco.com)**. Some preprocessing and data wrangling is 
performed by the [Udacity Course - Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).
The course provides the following data files in .csv format:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
- A very good [tutorial](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) on Pandas DataFrame and Series.
