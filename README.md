# Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Subproject
The repository contains the project information of the **python project** from Udacity Nanodegree 
**[Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)**.

### Project - Explore US Bikeshare Data
The goal of the project is to investivate **Bike Share Data** provided by **[Motivate](motivateco.com)**.
For simplicity, we will only explore data for the first six months of 2017 from the following cities:
- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington, DC

The project implements an interactive script in python that allows users to filter and explore raw data and to generate some 
descriptive statistics. The project helps participants to learn and apply python (together with numpy and pandas) to solve real world 
data analysis problems. This project is finished on Aug 14th, 2020.

### Requirements
The project uses the following programming language and packages:
- Python 3.6
- Numpy 1.19.1
- Pandas 1.1.0

### Data and Files used
The original data is provided by **[Motivate](motivateco.com)**. Some preprocessing and data wrangling is 
performed by the [Udacity Course - Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).
The course provides the following data files in .csv format:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
- A very good [tutorial](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) on Pandas DataFrame and Series.
